            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Keanu Ruddy Mine or simply known as Keanu. I was born and live in the beautiful Island Madagascar; I am an IT support Technician and a web developer apprentice. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                My experiences are mostly centered around technology, from Printer technician to IT support technician and recently diving into the realm of web development. I consider coding as an art, those colored lines of instruction have a form of charm and beauty and designed to create something even more beautiful.
            </p>
            <p> 
                During my free time I enjoy listening to music I like hearing the combination of different musical instrument with the vocal. I also like reading and my book taste is mostly oriented to gothic literature.
